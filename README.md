# WebScraping

## Description
_Module 11 Challenge - University of Adelaide - Data Analytics BootCamp_

Welcome to my analysis of Mars News and Weather. 

The analysis was performed using Beautiful Soup, Pandas and Matplotlib.

Part 1 Mars News scrapes the titles and preview text from the Mars news site. This data is then stored in the article.json file.
Part 2 Mars Weather scrapes the Mars weather data and analysis it for Mars weather conditions during a Martian year. The dataframe created is saved as mars_weather.csv.
